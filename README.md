# Motivation

This project is part of Data Scientist Nanodegree Profram from Udacity. The goal is to implement the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for DATA Mining). For this Project I choose the seatle Airbnb dataset to get some useful insights. Following are the 3 questions I looked in this dataset.

1. Anaylsis of room types, their percentage & price range on Airbnb
2. Analysis of Room availabily with months and their prices ranges to answer what time is best to visit seatle
3. Neighbourhood price Analysis to see which is the most priciest neighbourhood and which one is best among all to choose

# File Desciption

Their is one jupytr notebook file that answer the above questions. This file includes all the step done to answer these question.

There are three dataset files of seatle airbnb dataset that is downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)

listings.csv: including full descriptions and average review score
reviews.csv: including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
calendar.csv: including listing id and the price and availability for that day

# Results

Followings are the key findings:

1. Entire home/apt have high range on Airbnb and have $155 per night price for this room_type. Using this information people can plan their trip accordingly.
2. People mostly visit Seatle in summer season from July to September. As there is crowd in these month, the prices go high. By doing this analysis we can see that people prefer going to seatle in these months.
3. Mangolia is most expesive place 
4. On the ohter hand Ballard is in top 3 location wise and in top 4 rank wise and it also have low price as compared to others. so I think the best neighbourhood to visit is Ballard.
